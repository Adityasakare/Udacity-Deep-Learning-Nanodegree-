## Bike-Sharing prediction
In this project i build Neural network that  to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! It is used to predict daily bike rental ridership.
Applied Gradient Decent,  Backpropagation concepts from sratch.
The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)

### The training loss is below 0.09 and the validation loss is below 0.18.

### Predictaion Here, used the test data to view how well my network is modeling the data
