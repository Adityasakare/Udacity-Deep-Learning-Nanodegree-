## Face Generation
In this project i used used generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate new images of faces.
I trained a [DCGAN] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) on a dataset of faces.The goal was to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!
I used [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train adversarial networks.
