## Dog Breed Classifer
This is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project,.Given an image of a dog, algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
For this project i used VGG16 model.
The accuracy on test data
`Test Loss: 0.959668
Test Accuracy: 73% (615/836)`
