## TV Script Generation using RNN
In this project , i generated own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs.I used some part of the [Seinfeld](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098904/) dataset of scripts from 9 seasons.
The Neural Network generated a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
The RNN included an LSTM and one fully-connected layer.
